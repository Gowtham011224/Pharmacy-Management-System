# PHARMACY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

My idea of this project is to create a structured backend for pharmacy managment system, where supplies can be recorded into DB by the user. 
Strictly follows the ER Diagram drafted by me. Check it @`ER Diagram.jpg`

The aim of this project to ensure the ease of the users by providing structured DB like the ER diagram and user-friendly UI/UX.

USE XAMPP Control panel.
RUN APACHE AND MYSQL.
